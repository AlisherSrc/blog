        description="The James Webb Space Telescope reveals the inner workings of N79, a key star-forming region in the LMC, showcasing its efficiency and chemical uniqueness compared to the Milky Way.
      This image from the James Webb Space Telescope features an H II region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. This nebula, known as N79, is a region of interstellar atomic hydrogen that is ionized, captured here by Webb’s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI)."
